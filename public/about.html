<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science with a strong passion for technology 
  and its potential to drive innovation. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a solid
  foundation in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and .Net and 
  in-depth knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and software development principles.
</p>

<p>As a student, I actively engaged in various projects and assignments that allowed me to 
  apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.  I had the opportunity to intern at a 
  reputable company, where I  developed a website for SMEs by creating wireframes, prototypes,
  and mockups to illustrate user flows, interactions, and visual design elements using UI/UX 
  designing and HTML/CSS programming. This experience honed my coding and problem-solving 
  skills and highlighted the importance of creating user-friendly and scalable solutions.</p>
